# Rockstar-Auth-Flow
Rockstar Authentication Flow made in Java.

# The API that is used in this project is from: 
https://rockstar-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

# Look at this:
This is not made to be a huge project. Its to show how you authenticate within this API in Java. 
Don't expect a whole project. I might make a extended version for this project in the future.
